# Description
This project is a part of the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) programme. The task is to build a basis for a card game by using OOP in Python.

For the moment, only the basic functionalities have been implemented:
- A deck of cards is created for the provided number of players.

Time limit: 3 days

This is the first OOP project within the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to test our understanding of the OOP concept in Python (approx. 3 weeks from the start of the programme). The full duration of the programme is 7 months. 

# Personal situation
I am currently participating in the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to upskill into a career in data science.
